## Problem One

For this problem I utilized the numpy library to achieve a sufficiently random distribution of dots on my sphere and the plotly library in order to plot my points in 3d and allow for manipulation of the sphere.

For the estimation of the size of Antarctica I eyeballed it on the sphere after it was plotted and ended up with a satisfyingly close-to-truth estimation of its size.

For the estimation of the size of Africa I split it into two regions, the narrower Southern region and the wider Northern region, and looked at the approximate latitudes and longitudes. This also came up with a pretty good estimation.

My computer is also pretty powerful so I was able to play around with different amounts of dots being distributed and see how that affects the estimation.

## Problem Two

This was a far more challenging problem for me. I started out with some
